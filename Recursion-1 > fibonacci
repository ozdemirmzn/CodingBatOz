//The fibonacci sequence is a famous bit of mathematics, and it happens to have a recursive definition. 
//The first two values in the sequence are 0 and 1 (essentially 2 base cases). Each subsequent 
//value is the sum of the previous two values, so the whole sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on. 
//Define a recursive fibonacci(n) method that returns the nth fibonacci number, with n=0 representing the start of the sequence.

    sum=second;
